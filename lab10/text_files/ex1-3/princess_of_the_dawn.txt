There's rain on the mountain
A white frost on the moors
It's an epoch of eternity
Waters touch the holy shore
It's a land of mystery
The world of unseen eyes
You can feel the shadow of a princess
She waits for you inside
The guardians of God play the pawns
Beg for mercy - hail the queen
Princess of the Dawn
In the war of the dragons
Young blood ran it's course
They fell to his blade
The knight Iron Horse
A forgotten priest
Disappearing in the haze
A chamber of vestal virgins
Twilight is her slave
The Wizard of Oz moved the pawns
Life for Satan - dust to dust
Princess of the Dawn
On the day of the testament
The seventh moon was raging fire
Heaven cried for the sacrifice
The midnight sun was rising higher
The Beauty and the Beast
Lies in her royal crypt
Her kiss is bitter sweet
Death upon her lips
The Holy Grail held the pawns
Kings and bishops bow to grace
Princess of the Dawn
The guardians of God play the pawns
Beg for mercy - hail the queen
Princess of the Dawn
A new day dawns for heaven and earth
A first sunbeam is killing the night
Once upon a time for ever more
The gloom with the spirit of that Lady in White
Princess - Princess - Princess of the Dawn
Princess - Princess - Princess of the Dawn
Princess - Princess - Princess of the Dawn
Princess - Princess - Princess of the Dawn
