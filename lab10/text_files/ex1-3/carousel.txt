We saw the wonder world, of all the wild wild horses
Flying around, like an eagle in the sky
But we had been told, of the danger of burning roses
Longing for you, and they're never asking why
Don't touch the flame
Run through the fire
Calling your name
We're flying higher, to the edge of the world
Carousel
Of broken dreams
Turning around in a circle
Carousel
You know what it means
Making a fool out of me
Carousel
Of broken dreams
Turning around in a circle
Carousel
You know what it means
Making a fool out of me
Carousel
Far out in the distance, there was a place we once called home
Lost forever, filled with emptiness and moan
The rising force of evil, broke the chains of destination
Hard to believe, but there will be no recreation
Don't touch the flame
Run through the fire
Calling your name
We're flying higher
Carousel
Of broken dreams
Turning around in a circle
Carousel
You know what it means
Making a fool out of me
Carousel
Of broken dreams
Turning around in a circle
Carousel
You know what it means
Making a fool out of me
Yeeeeh
Yeah
Carousel
Of broken dreams
Turning around in a circle
Carousel
You know what it means
Making a fool out of me
Carousel
Of broken dreams
Turning around in a circle
Carousel
You know what it means
Making a fool out of me
Carousel
Of broken dreams
Turning around in a circle
Carousel
You know what it means
Making a fool out of me (Carousel)
Make a fool out of me (Carousel)
Carousel
Make a fool out of me (Carousel)
You know what it means (Carousel)
Don't touch the flame (Carousel)
Run through the fire
Calling your name
We're flying higher (Carousel)
Carousel
Carousel yeah (Carousel)
Make a fool out of me
(Don't make a fool of me)
