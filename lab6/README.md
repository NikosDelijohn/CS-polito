## Part 1 – Single functions

**[1.1]** **Vowel Count.** Write the function: 
```
def count_vowels(string)
```
That returns the number of vowels in the string. Vowels are the letters `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u`;  as well as their respective capitalized versions. 

**[1.2]** **Word Count.** Write the function: 
```
def count_words(string)
```
Returns the number of words in the string. Words are sequences of characters separated by spaces (assume that between two consecutive words, there is exactly one space). For example, `count_words("Mary had a little lamb")` returns `5`. 

How could the exercise be extended so that strings, where there are multiple spaces between words, are correctly treated? 

**[1.3]** **Geometric solids.** Write functions:
 ```
 def sphere_volume(r)
 def sphere_surface(r)
 def cylinder_volume(r, h)
 def cylinder_surface(r, h)
 def cone_volume(r, h)
 def cone_surface(r, h)
```
Such functions are devoted to calculate the volume and surface area of a sphere of radius `r`, a cylinder with a circular base of radius `r` and height `h`, and a cone with a circular base with radius `r` and height `h`. Then write a program that asks the user to enter the values `r` and `h`, then the program calls the six functions and display the output results. 

**[1.4]** **Bank Balance.** Write a function that calculates the balance of a bank account by crediting interest annually. The function receives as parameters: the number of years, the initial balance, and the annual interest rate. 

## Part 2 – Algorithms that make use of functions

**[2.1]** **NGOs.** A non-governmental organization needs a program to calculate the share of financial benefit to be allocated to each family in need of assistance. The formula is as follows: 
   - I. If the family's annual income is between `$30000` and `$40000` and the family has at least `3` children, the subsidy is `$1000` for each child;  
   - II. If the family's annual income is between `$20000` and  `$30000` and the family has at least `2` children, the subsidy is `$1500` for each child;  
   - III. If the family's annual income is less than `$20,000`, the subsidy is `$2,000` for each child. 
Write a function to perform these calculations. Then write a program that, in a cycle, asks the user to provide the annual income and the number of children of each family requesting the subsidy, displaying the corresponding value returned by the function. Use  `–1` as the sentinel value to finish entering data. 

**[2.2]** **Roman Numbers.** Write a program that converts a Roman numeral, such as `MCMLXXVIII`, into its decimal representation. 
Tip: First, write a function that returns the numeric value of each individual letter, then use the following algorithm: 
```
total = 0 
s = string corresponding to the Roman numeral
Until s is empty
   If s has length 1, or the value of its first character is greater than or equal to the value of its second character
      Add the value of the first character of s to the total
      Remove the first character from s
   Otherwise 
      difference = (value of the second character of s) – (value of the first character of s)
      Add the difference value to the total
      Remove the first two characters from s
```

**[2.3]** **Aerodynamic drag.** The drag force on a car is given by:

$$F_{D}=\frac{1}{2}\rho \nu^2 A C_{D} $$

Where  $\rho$ is the air density $(1.23kg/m^3)$,  $\nu$ is the velocity in $m/s$,  $A$ is the projected area of the car $(2.5m^2)$ and $C_{D}$ is the drag coefficient $(0.2)$. The amount of power in watts needed to overcome the resistance force is $P=F_{D}\nu$, and the equivalent power in horsepower is $H_p=P/745.7$. Write a program that receives the car's speed and calculates the power in watts and horsepower needed to overcome the resulting resistance force.

**[2.4]** **Electrical wire.** The electric wire is a cylindrical conductor covered with an insulating material. The resistance of a wire is given by the formula:

$$R=\frac{\rho L}{A}=\frac{4\rho L}{\pi d^2}$$

Where  $\rho$ is the resistivity of the conductor $L$ and $A$, and $d$ are the length, cross-sectional area, and wire diameter, respectively. The resistivity of copper is $(1.678 \times 10^{-8} \ohm m)$. The diameter $d$ of the wire, is commonly specified by the American Wire Gauge (`AWG`), which is an integer value. The diameter of an AWG- $n$ wire is given by the formula:

$$d=0.127 \times 92 ^{\frac{36-n}{39}}mm$$

Write a function
```
def diameter(wire_gauge)
```
that accepts the wire gauge and returns the corresponding diameter. Write another function
```
def copper_wire_resistance(length, wire_gauge)
```
that accepts the length and gauge of a piece of copper wire and returns its resistance.

The resistivity of aluminum is  $(2.82 \times 10^{-8} \ohm m)$. Write a third function
```
def aluminum_wire_resistance(length, wire_gauge)
```
that accepts the length and gauge of a piece of aluminum wire and returns its resistance. Then write a program to test these functions.
