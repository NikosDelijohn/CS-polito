# Computer Science Laboratory \#1

## Part 1

**[1.1]** In a scheduling program, we want to check whether two appointments overlap. For simplicity, appointments start at a full hour, and we use military time (with hours 0–23). The following pseudocode describes an algorithm that determines whether the appointment with starting time `start1` and ending time `end1` overlaps with the appointment with starting time `start2` and ending time `end2`.

```
If start1 > start2
    s = start1 
Else
    s = start2 
If end1 < end2
    e = end1 
Else
    e = end2
If s < e
    The appointments overlap. 
Else 
    The appointments don’t overlap.
```

Check this algorithm with the following example values used as test cases: an appointment from `10–12` and the second one from `11–13`. Second example: an appointment from `10–11` and one from `12–13`. 

**[1.2]** The following algorithm yields the season (Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter) for a given month and day.

```
If month is 1, 2 or 3
    season = “Winter” 
Else, if month is 4, 5 or 6
    season = “Spring” 
Else, if month is 7, 8 or 9
    season = “Summer” 
Else, if month is 10, 11 or 12
    season = “Fall” 
If month can be divided by 3 and day is >= 21 
    If season is “Winter”
        season = “Spring” 
    Else, if season is “Spring”
        season = “Summer” 
    Else, if season is “Summer”
        season = “Fall” 
    Else
        season = “Winter”  

```
Draw the corresponding flowchart. Verify the correctness of the algorithm with a series of test date. 

**[1.3]** You want to find out which fraction of your car’s use is for moving to work, and which is for personal use. You know the one-way distance from your home to your work place. For a particular period, you recorded the beginning and ending kilometers on the odometer and the number of working days. Write an algorithm to settle this question. 

**[1.4]** Make a plan for tiling a rectangular bathroom floor with alternating black and white tiles measuring 10 × 10 cm. The floor dimensions, measured in meters, are multiples of 10. 

**[1.5]** A student that is about to finish his/her high school and wants to choose which University apply to. They can base their decision on other people suggestions, and on the mean salary obtainable one year after graduation. Most of the faculties they are interested in offer statistics on the employment of grad students. How can they decide?

**[1.6]** Know when to stop. The value of π can be computed according to the following formula: 

$$\frac{\pi}{4} = 1 - \frac{1}{3}+ \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + ...$$

Write an algorithm to compute π. Because the formula is an infinite series and an algorithm must stop after a finite number of steps, you should stop when you have the result determined to six significant digits. 

**[1.7]** Consider the following algorithm:

The Babylonian method was the first algorithm used for approximating $\sqrt{S}$.It proceeds as follows: 

  - 1] Begin with an arbitrary poitive starting value $x_0$ (the closer to the actual square root of $S$ the better).
  - 2] Let $x_{n+1}$ be the average of $x_n$ and $S/x_n$
  - 3] Repeat step 2 until the desired accuracy is achieved. 
  
It can be represented recursively as: 
$$x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2} (x_n + \frac{S}{x_n} )$$

Use this algorithm to compute $\sqrt{3}$.

# Part 2 

Copy and paste the following code inside `PyCharm`: 

```
def compute_operating_cost(annual_km_driven, years, fuel_cost, km_per_liter): 

    annual_fuel_consumed = annual_km_driven / km_per_liter 
    annual_fuel_cost = fuel_cost * annual_fuel_consumed
    operating_cost = annual_fuel_cost * years

    return operating_cost 

car_1_price = 10000
car_2_price = 20000

car_1_km_per_liter = 10 
car_2_km_per_liter = 20 

years = int(input("For how many years will you drive this car? "))
km_per_year = int(input("On average, how many km will you drive each year? " ))
fuel_cost = float(input("On average, how many dollars does it cost a liter of fuel? "))

annual_km_driven = years * km_per_year 

car_1_operating_cost = compute_operating_cost(annual_km_driven, years, fuel_cost, car_1_km_per_liter)
car_2_operating_cost = compute_operating_cost(annual_km_driven, years, fuel_cost, car_2_km_per_liter)

if car_1_total_cost < car_2_total_cost: 
    print("Car 1 is less expensive overall")
else: 
    print("Car 2 is less expensive overall")

```

Debug the following program to understand how variables are assigned and computed inside a python program.
